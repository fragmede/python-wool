Python-wool
---

Python-wool is a simple wrapper for python that will:
 * activate venvs found in a directory named venv automatically.

With this, I can do:

    python ~/projects/foo/bar.py
    and the venv in ~/projects/foo/venv will be used.

~/projets/python/python-wool/python-wool ~/projects


Use this by installing this package, and then aliasing python to python-wool.


TODO:
 * Have it automatically create venvs if a requirements.txt is found.
